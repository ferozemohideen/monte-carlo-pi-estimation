                        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">The concept of the Monte Carlo simulation originated
                            from Polish-American mathematician <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>, who, apart from
                            his love of thermonuclear weapons, was a big fan
                            of solitaire. He spent a lot of time playing the game while recovering from an illness, and
                            sought a way to predict his chance of winning using combinatorics. Despite being an
                            incredible mathematician, he failed to do so.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Ulam then supposed that instead of calculating a
                            probability, he would just try playing a few hands, count the number of hands he won, then
                            divide by the number of games played. He realized, however, that it might take him a very
                            long time to win even a single game, so he turned to his friend <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>&nbsp;to help
                            him <em>simulate </em>them instead. von Neumann used his new <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a>&nbsp;to
                            simulate multiple games of solitaire within a few hours of computation, a task that would
                            take microseconds today.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Formally, the Monte Carlo simulation is a method of
                            estimating the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of inferential statistics.
                            It involves making predictions about a <em>population</em>, or a set of examples,
                            using information about a <em>sample, </em>or a proper subset of the population. In the
                            solitaire example, the population is the set of all possible games of solitaire - a very
                            large set - and the sample is the set of simulated
                            games done by the computer. The key fact that Monte Carlo simulations rely upon is that if
                            one chooses a sample at random, it tends to exhibit the same properties as the population
                            from which it is drawn.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">There are many applications to the Monte Carlo
                            simulation, belonging to fields like <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference_in_phylogeny">computational
                                biology</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_simulation_Monte_Carlo">fluid
                                dynamics</a>,
                            and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing">computer
                                graphics</a>.&nbsp;The following section visualizes an example of using a simulation to
                            estimate the value of pi.</p>
                        <h2 style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">Estimation of Pi using a Monte Carlo Simulation
                        </h2>
                        <p style="font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;">One can estimate pi using something as simple as a
                            dartboard; shoot darts at a square board, and the number of darts that land within 1 unit
                            from the origin (or in a circle of radius 1 unit) divided by the number of darts outside
                            the circle is a simple estimate of the ratio between the area of the circle and that of the
                            square: pi. Theoretically, with infinite darts, one could determine the exact value of pi.
                            The interactive example below simulates
                            the throwing of many darts and the resulting estimate of pi.</p>
